# Forge

A free, private, offline-first workout app. It generates workouts from your goals, equipment and recent training, tracks every set, and recommends progressive overload from your logged numbers.

- **No accounts, no servers, no paid APIs.** Your data lives in your browser's local storage.
- **Works offline** once it has loaded. YouTube videos are the only thing that needs a connection.
- **Installable on iPhone** as a home-screen app (a PWA).
- **No build step.** It is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The charts and icons are written from scratch, so there are no external libraries or CDNs.

## Design

A quiet, precise interface in the spirit of Apple, Linear and Things: generous whitespace, one typeface, one accent, and very few containers.

**Look**
- **Type:** [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), bundled in `fonts/` (OFL), with optical sizes so large titles use the tighter Display cut. Every weight, rep, timer and stat uses tabular figures.
- **Color:** a soft neutral background, near-black text and a single pine-green accent, used only for the primary action and completion. Heavy and burnout appear as small rust and amber dots; nothing else is colored. A dark theme is in Settings.

**Navigation**
- **Desktop:** a quiet sidebar with Home, Generate, Train, Exercises, History, Progress and Settings.
- **Phone:** a 5-tab bar (Home, Generate, Train, History, Progress). Exercises and Settings sit in the top bar.

**Screens**
- **Home:** one focal "Generate workout" panel, a 7-day strip, the three most recent workouts, and a three-number summary of the last 30 days.
- **Generate:**
  - Type chips plus two options (exercise count and duration); everything else sits under *More options*.
  - The plan is a single list. Each row shows the name, muscle, sets × reps, the suggested weight from your history and a subtle intensity marker, with video, swap and more buttons.
- **Train:**
  - Navigation hides and the screen focuses on the current exercise.
  - Completed sets show as a short checklist.
  - A large editor has −/+ weight and rep controls. Weight steps to the next dumbbell you own; values are pre-filled from your last session.
  - One "Complete set" tap logs the set and starts the rest timer. Supersets alternate automatically.
- **Progress:** one chart at a time (Strength, Frequency or Volume tabs), then personal records and weekly sets per muscle group.

## Features

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Generator** | 13 workout types (Full Body, Push, Pull, Legs, Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Biceps, Triceps, Core, Cardio, Custom multi-muscle). Settings for exercise count (or fit to time), duration, equipment, supersets, priority muscles and muscles to avoid. Each exercise has Swap, Lock and Remove buttons. Regenerate keeps locked exercises, "Re-roll intensities" keeps the exercises and re-draws their intensities, and you can add exercises by hand. |
| **Randomized intensity** | There are four classes: **heavy** (5–8), **regular** (8–12), **burnout** (12–20+) and **standard** (the exercise's own recommendation, with no label). Each exercise is drawn *independently* from configurable odds (default 22 / 30 / 16 / 32). The odds are weighted by suitability: heavy leans toward compound lifts early in the session; burnout leans toward isolation work late in the session and never goes on spinal-loading lifts. An exercise can never get a class it isn't eligible for. There is no fixed formula, so 0 heavy, 3 heavy, all-regular and 2 + 2 are all possible. The only safety rails are a cap of half the session for heavy and a third for burnout; no minimums are forced. Tap any intensity label to change it. Settings can switch to fixed counts instead. |
| **Selection logic** | Slot templates per workout type (for example, full body = squat + chest press + back pull + hips + arms + core). Exercises are scored on goal emphasis (lower chest, arm size, obliques), priority muscles, favorites, weekly volume shortfall per muscle, fatigue from the last 48 hours, overlap within the workout, recency and difficulty. Heavy work goes to compound lifts, burnouts go to finishers, and supersets pair non-competing muscles. |
| **Active workout** | A set table with *previous*, weight, reps and ✓ columns. Blank fields fall back to last time's numbers. Supports per-set weights, adding/removing sets, skipping, replacing, reordering, notes and an effort rating. A rest timer starts on its own (with sound and vibration) and is superset-aware. |
| **Progressive overload** | Uses your recorded sets (double progression). For example, 30 lb × 10, 10, 9 gives "Maintain 30 lb — aim for 10, 10, 10". All sets at the top of the range → add weight (+5 lb upper-body dumbbell or +2.5 if you have micro-plates, +5–10 lb lower body, snapped to dumbbells you own). Within range → add reps. Missed reps once → hold; missed twice → drop about 10%. Long layoffs restart conservatively. Bodyweight lifts get more reps, added load or a harder variation. **Weights only change when you tap Apply.** Every recommendation explains why. |
| **Library** | 185 exercises, each with muscles, equipment, category, movement pattern, difficulty, sets, reps, rest, intensity class and a video link. Search, filters, favorites, exclusions, custom exercises and editing are supported. |
| **History** | Permanent log with every set. Open any workout, repeat it, use it as a template, edit notes or delete it. |
| **Progress** | Workouts, per-week average, sets and volume; a workouts-per-week chart; a consistency heatmap; per-exercise charts (est. 1RM, top weight, volume, reps); PRs; weekly volume per muscle group against targets. Everything is calculated from logged data only. |
| **Data** | Export a JSON backup, then import it to merge or fully restore. Erase all data. Storage is persisted between sessions. |

### Your profile (pre-loaded, editable in Settings)
- **Goals:** lean out; lower-chest emphasis; bigger arms; obliques. Priority muscles are chest, biceps, triceps, abs and obliques.
- **Schedule:** 3 strength sessions + 2 runs per week. Full body preferred. Supersets on, burnouts on.
- **Equipment:** dumbbells 5–60 lb, bench, cable machine, lat pulldown, seated row, medicine ball, bodyweight and a pull-up bar. The pull-up bar is included because you want to keep improving pull-ups; untick it if you don't have one. There is no EZ bar and no cable ankle strap.
- **Restrictions:** no conventional deadlifts, no Romanian deadlifts (including DB and single-leg), no reverse-grip dumbbell pressing.
- **Favorites:** Sissy Squat and Pull-Up. The generator prefers them.

### About the videos
No video IDs are hard-coded, because they can't be checked offline and they break over time. Each exercise opens a **YouTube search** for that exercise's form tutorial. If you find a video you like, paste its link into the exercise (Library → exercise → paste link, or Edit). After that it **plays embedded** inside the app.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000     # or: npx serve .
# open http://localhost:8000
```
You can also double-click `index.html`. Everything except offline caching and install works from `file://`.

## Deploy for free (needed for iPhone install + offline)

PWAs need HTTPS. The simplest free host is **GitHub Pages**:

1. Push this repository to GitHub. It is already at `sdrucker6637/workoutsite`.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**. Under *Build and deployment*, choose **Deploy from a branch**, pick your branch (e.g. `main`) and the `/ (root)` folder, then **Save**.
3. After about a minute the site is live at `https://sdrucker6637.github.io/workoutsite/`.
4. On your iPhone, open that URL in **Safari** → **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**.

Netlify Drop (drag the folder onto app.netlify.com/drop) and Cloudflare Pages also work and are free.

**Updating:** after changing files, bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` so installed copies fetch the new version.

> Data is stored per browser and per origin. The home-screen app and the Safari tab keep **separate** storage on iOS. Use Settings → Export / Import to move data between them, and export a backup now and then.

## Tests

```bash
node tests/engine.test.js                          # generator, intensity statistics over 3,200 workouts, progression, PRs, import/export (≈37k assertions)
python3 -m http.server 8765 & node tests/e2e.test.js   # full browser flow (needs Playwright)
```
The end-to-end test generates every workout type, swaps exercises, logs a full session, refreshes mid-workout, saves, and checks that the next session shows previous weights and an increase recommendation that is only applied on approval. It also checks the v1 → v2 data upgrade, intensity variety across repeated generations through the UI, the intensity picker, PR detection, the charts, export → wipe → import, persistence after refresh, the theme toggle and offline loading.
